Currently, you can find some of my early work from General Assembly on this page.

<a href="http://enigmatic-caverns-6880.herokuapp.com/">Travel App</a>
<br />
This was a group project at General Assembly. We wanted to create an app that would help the user find events and entertainment on a vacation. My part of the application was the integration of the Google Maps API, and the deployment to Heroku. You can find the source code on Github <a href="https://github.com/schersh/Travel_app_project_3">here.</a>
<br />

<a href="http://onethirdtwothirds.herokuapp.com/">One-Third, Two-Thirds</a>
<br />
A personal timeboxing app was my first Ruby on Rails project. This was my first time implementing back-end functionality and user authorization, as well as deploying on Heroku. Check out the source code <a href="https://github.com/Cajam/One-Third-Two-Thirds">here,</a> as well as the accompanying demo video I produced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1W8MmfYdjA">on YouTube.</a>
<br />

<a href="http://cajam.github.io/wdi_project_1/">Flash Cards</a>
<br />
My first app! I wrote this program a couple weeks after I started learning the basics of coding. It's a simple flash card game that allows you to create your own cards. If you really want to see some amateur JavaScript, <a href="https://github.com/Cajam/wdi_project_1">click here for the source code.</a>
